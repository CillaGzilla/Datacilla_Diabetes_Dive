-- Insight Summary--

‚úÖ 1. High Prevalence of Diabetes
Over 85‚Äì90% of patients matching these criteria are diabetic.

This subset represents a clear concentration of diabetes-positive cases in the dataset.

‚úÖ 2. Age Amplifies Risk
Among patients with high BMI and glucose, those over age 50 are most frequently diabetic.

Age acts as a multiplier when combined with obesity and hyperglycemia.

‚úÖ 3. Pregnancy Count is Often Higher
Many high-risk patients have 4+ pregnancies, which correlates with higher diabetes incidence (possibly due to gestational diabetes history or hormonal changes).

‚úÖ 4. Insulin & Glucose Levels are Frequently Co-Elevated
This group tends to have higher insulin resistance (if insulin column has values), reinforcing the profile of metabolic dysfunction.
